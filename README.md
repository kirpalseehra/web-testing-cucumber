# web-testing-cucumber

### Description
I have created a cucumber-based testing framework using Gherking syntax to test the 'https://www.bbc.co.uk' website, specifically the login page. I have taken a POM approach by including separate pages for the homepage and login page as well as, organising my directory structure in an easy to read format. I have created UI tests that check whether the error messages that appear on screen for an end user for different scenarios are correct using capybara.

### Languages

2. Gem install cucumber if not already installed on device
2. Run 'cucumber' in terminal

### Challenges
1. Creating instance variables and attribute accessors to store the error message string and then using those variables within the tests
2. Creating a POM

### Learning points
1. Better understanding of how to apply the gherkin syntax within cucumber in order to create UI tests
2. Greater knowledge of storing strings within attribute accessors and applying them to the UI tests 
3. How to target specific elements within a web page using IDs
